                        <p>I am an academic researcher, who identifies as a political theorist with special interests in the history of political philosophy, critical approaches to political sociology, and comparative political economy. I am also a small venture, social entrepreneur, fostering community development through creative arts practice, and promoting access to healthcare, higher education, and arts & cultural resources.</p>

                                <p>My research focuses on how the performative elements of labor set the conditions for political action. On these questions, I am oriented by a wide range of theoretical and aesthetic texts, but I have a particular affinity for Hellenic Philosophy, French and German thought, as well as public interest law. I tend to approach these themes through a set of questions about the theory of the self, the critique of capitalism, and structural transformations in the social sphere. </p>
